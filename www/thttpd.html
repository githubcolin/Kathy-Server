    <p>
      thttpd is a simple, small, portable, fast, and secure HTTP server.
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt> Simple: </dt>
      <dd>
	It handles only the minimum necessary to implement HTTP/1.1.
        Well, maybe a little more than the minimum.
      </dd>
      <dt> Small: </dt>
      <dd>
	See the <a href="http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/benchmarks.html">comparison chart</a>.
        It also has a very small run-time size, since it does not fork and
        is very careful about memory allocation.
      </dd>
      <dt> Portable: </dt>
      <dd>
	It compiles cleanly on most any Unix-like OS, specifically including
        FreeBSD, SunOS 4, Solaris 2, BSD/OS, Linux, OSF.
      </dd>
      <dt> Fast: </dt>
      <dd>
	In typical use it's about as fast as the best full-featured servers
        (Apache, NCSA, Netscape).
        Under extreme load it's much faster.
      </dd>
      <dt> Secure: </dt>
      <dd>
	It goes to great lengths to protect the web server machine against
        attacks and breakins from other sites.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>
      It also has one extremely useful feature
      (<a href="http://www.acme.com/software/thttpd/thttpd_man.html#THROTTLING">URL-traffic-based throttling</a>)
      that no other server currently has.
      Plus, it supports
      <a href="http://www.ipv6.org/">IPv6</a>
      out of the box, no patching required.

      How do you pronounce thttpd?  Ask Bloom County's Bill the Cat, as seen in
      <a href="http://ars.userfriendly.org/cartoons/?id=19990926&mode=classic">User Friendly</a>,
      the excellent geek-positive comic.

      You can also use this fun Bill-based thttpd badge on your own web site
      if you like.

      Are you using thttpd?
      There's a mailing list:
      <a href="mailto:thttpd@mail.acme.com">thttpd@mail.acme.com</a>
      (<a href="mailto:thttpd-request@mail.acme.com">thttpd-request@mail.acme.com</a>
      to subscribe,
      <a href="http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=thttpd&r=1&w=2">archived here</a>).
      And an announcements-only mailing list:
      <a href="mailto:thttpd-announce@mail.acme.com">thttpd-announce@mail.acme.com</a>
      (<a href="mailto:thttpd-announce-request@mail.acme.com">thttpd-announce-request@mail.acme.com</a>
      to subscribe).
      Anything sent to the announcements list also goes to the regular list,
      so you don't need to be on both.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also if you have any nice quotes I can use, send 'em in.
      For instance:
    </p>

    <blockquote><i>
      "I got thttpd compiled and running on the web server at work in no time
      at all, or close enough for my purposes, and I really like it, and when I
      told the rest of the crew what the footprint was they almost coughed up
      their lunches."
      </i><blockquote>
        -- Martin Kelly
    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <blockquote><i>
      "Our load averages have dropped significantly since we moved our
      graphics to thttpd."
      </i><blockquote>
        -- Randy Cosby
    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <blockquote><i>
      "i just grabbed thttpd and set it up on my personal box to test it out,
      and i am amazed at how quick and easy that was.
      i'm a hardcore apache expert but this was just phenomenally simple.
      very refreshing."
      </i><blockquote>
        -- Jon Drukman
    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <blockquote><i>
      "I switched to thttpd on my underpowered server about 20 minutes after
      downloading it."
      </i><blockquote>
        -- Daniel Quinlan
    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <blockquote><i>
      "I just wanted to let you know that I installed thttpd
      and it works really great.
      The server is a P3/500 w/512 megs running FreeBSD 3.3 and when it
      was using apache it was at about 11 load average and kept throwing connections
      and errors.
      Now it runs dandy with thttpd and the load average is between 0.1 and 0.2.
      The thttpd process is at about 200 megs size and the system is usually 60% idle.
      The machine serves about 400 simultaneous connections (more on peak hours)."
      </i><blockquote>
        -- Petru Paler
    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <blockquote><i>
      "I just upgraded my htdocs development box from apache to thttpd.
      I was looking for a httpd that would use less memory - I found
      one that was faster and easier to use as well :)"
      </i><blockquote>
        -- David Brownlee
    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <blockquote><i>
      "We are using thttpd to serve all of our images.
      We are a huge traffic site.
      We moved about a month ago from a barebones apache.
      The load on our web servers dropped dramatically, as did the memory usage!
      woohoo!"
      </i><blockquote>
        -- Jeremy Brand
    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <blockquote><i>
      "Configuration: Athlon 700, 800MB RAM.
      Before: Apache, load=170, machine unusable, capped at 4Mbits, SWAPPING.
      After: thttpd, load=.09 (yes, that's point-zero-nine), happy at 8Mbits, only
      using ~300MB of RAM."
      </i><blockquote>
        -- Jon Oringer
    </blockquote></blockquote>

    <p>
      New in version 2.27:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> ??? </li>
    </ul>
    -->

    <p>
      New in version 2.26:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Ignore ECONNABORTED on accept(). </li>
      <li> Correctly implemented the config-file option change from "nosymlink" to "nosymlinkcheck", which was supposedly done in version 2.24.  </li>
      <li> Removed mailto: link from default index page. </li>
      <li> Allow CGIs to provide both Location and Status headers. (A. Skrobov) </li>
      <li> Better logic for figuring out CGI SERVER_NAME environment variable. (Oleg) </li>
      <li> Updated for clang, and general cleanup. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      New in version 2.25b:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Move fdwatch initialization before the chroot, so that /dev/poll can work. </li>
      <li> Multiple fdwatch cleanups and fixes (Adam Zell). </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      New in version 2.25:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Prohibit "Host: ." and "Host: .." (David Leadbeater). </li>
      <li> Don't free memory prematurely on SIGUSR1 (A.D.F.). </li>
      <li> Use the specified charset in directory listings and errors (Jonas Ohlsson). </li>
      <li> Lowered THROTTLE_TIME from 60 seconds to 2 seconds, plus more aggressive computation of sending rate, to improve throttle reaction time (E Frank Ball). </li>
      <li> Added code to redistribute the throttled bandwidth fairly among the currently sending connections. </li>
      <li> Some more throttling changes that smooth things out a lot. </li>
      <li> Added an experimental limitation on the number of simultaneous CGIs. </li>
      <li> Chown the log file when starting as root, so that it can later be re-opened when running as nobody (or whatever user you configure).  Also tweak the logfile pathname so that it still works inside a chroot tree. </li>
      <li> Make sure URL paths begin with a slash. </li>
      <li> Generate multiple MIME encodings in the correct order, and with the correct separator. </li>
      <li> Ignore EINTR on read() and write(). </li>
      <li> Fix error in httpd_read_fully() and httpd_write_fully() that could cause incorrect data to be read or written (Daniel Jensen). </li>
      <li> Don't attempt to double-free a file descriptor if a connection times out while it is paused for throttling. </li>
      <li> Save and restore errno in signal handlers. </li>
      <li> The non-local referer check is no longer fooled by URLs with query strings. </li>
      <li> Simplified handling of HAVE_INT64T (Trisk).  If this causes problems, e.g. if there are still systems which don't have "long long", we can back out the change. </li>
      <li> Keep a list of free connection structs, instead of doing linear search to find a free one (Adam Zell). </li>
      <li> Added config.h option FLUSH_LOG_EVERY_TIME - if it's turned off, the log does not get fflushed after each request (Adam Zell). </li>
      <li> Multiple robustness improvements to the fdwatch module (Adam Zell). </li>
      <li> Added /dev/poll support to fdwatch (Adam Zell). </li>
      <li> Automatically add no-cache control header on error responses. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>

      <li> Fix minor problem with returning unknown protocol on some errors. </li>
      <li> Changed the config-file option for diabling symlink checking from "nosymlink" to "nosymlinkcheck" to make its function clearer. </li>
      <li> Allow blank lines in the config file. </li>
      <li> Handle more than one SIGHUP and SIGUSR2 (Cameron Gregory). </li>
      <li> Slight change to handle_newconnect() to better deal with unexpected errors from accept(), such as running out of file descriptors (Alex Keahan). </li>
      <li> Added optional minimum rate to throttles. </li>
      <li> Stats syslog messages downgraded from LOG_NOTICE to LOG_INFO. </li>
      <li> Use unsigned short consistently for port number. </li>
      <li> Prohibit slashes in the Host: header (Marcus Breiing). </li>
      <li> Added a -dd data_dir flag and corresponding config-file option. </li>
      <li> Got rid of the old timer-based zombie process reaper, replacing it with a SIGCHLD handler. </li>
      <li> Changed the idle connection checking from using a separate timer for each connection to using a single timer that checks all active connections. </li>
      <li> Correction to missing-slash directory redirect with query string. </li>
      <li> Added a watchdog alarm handler that forces a core dump if thttpd stops running its timers for too long. </li>
      <li> Don't send Content-Length header on 304 Not Modified responses. </li>
      <li> Allow user-agent log entries to be up to 200 characters long, instead only of 80. </li>
      <li> Fixed buffer overflow bug in defang(). </li>
      <li> Re-arranged the order of calling de_dotdot() so that it doesn't get applied to query strings. </li>
      <li> Some fixes for the syslogtocern script (paul fox). </li>
      <li> Changed configure script to use "gcc -dumpversion" instead of "gcc --version" (Ed Goforth). </li>
      <li> Changed most uses of \r and \n to \015 and \012 (Jens Bauer). </li>
      <li> In ssi.c, lack of PATH_INFO is now non-fatal (David Phillips). </li>
      <li> Some improvements to fdwatch (David Burgess). </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      New in version 2.23:

      <li> Use memmove instead of memcpy. </li>
      <li> Fix to de_dotdot (Mark Dunlap). </li>
      <li> Corrected some uses of size_t and off_t. </li>
      <li> Rewrote figure_mime() to do binary search.  If you're updating an existing installation, you'll need to do a <code>./configure ; make clean ; make</code>. </li>
      <li> Removed the x- from gzip and compress in mime_encodings.txt. </li>
      <li> Added rudimentary option to set cache-control headers. </li>
      <li> Simplified the IPv6 ifdefs. </li>
      <li> Allow filenames with ? in them (Cameron Gregory). </li>
      <li> Some improvements to the mmap cache - added a "panic mode" if you run out of address space, added DESIRED_MAX_MAPPED_BYTES config.h option. </li>
      <li> Lowered OCCASIONAL_TIME from five minutes to two minutes. </li>
      <li> Added include of config.h in mmc.c (A.D.F.). </li>
      <li> Fixed compile nit in syslog.c (Peter Harris). </li>
      <li> Added configure test for int64_t. </li>
      <li> Fix CGI variable AUTH_TYPE (Alexandre CHERIF). </li>
      <li> Slight correction to SIGUSR1 handling. </li>
      <li> Split clear_connection() into two routines, one which sends a possible buffered response and the other which ignores such (David Burgess). </li>
      <li> Remove /./ in de_dotdot() (Dana Dahlstrom). </li>

      <li> Added index.xhtml and index.xht to INDEX_NAMES (suggested by Dave Hodder). </li>
      <li> Fix to error messages for CGI. </li>
      <li> Got rid of the custom-jiggered syslog.c, now we just use the standard system version.  Also added a paragraph in the man page about the syslogd flags needed to make syslogging work from inside a chroot tree. </li>
      <li> Fixed problem involving a connection going into lingering-close mode multiple times (Cameron Gregory). </li>
      <li> Added a bunch of checks to the fdwatch package to make it more robust. </li>

      <li> Fix to kqueue code (Alexey Dokuchaev, Michal Suszycki, qhwt@myrealbox.com). </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      New in version 2.22:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Fix for the garbage characters after POST data hack. </li>
      <li> Fix for poll() problem. </li>

    </ul>

    <p>
      New in version 2.21b:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Fix for lingering-close problem from Taner Halicioglu - on some systems, it was hanging the server. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      New in version 2.21:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> ANSI compile nits in timers.h and libhttpd.c.  I thought I had already fixed these. </li>
      <li> Two small fixes to USR1 signal handling.  Should be more reliable now. </li>
      <li> Fixed the "throttle sending count was negative" bug. </li>
      <li> 503 Service Overloaded errors were not getting logged. </li>
      <li> New throttling syslogs. </li>
      <li> Tuning tweaks to throttling, it's much more accurate now. </li>
      <li> Tweak to the sample log-rotation script. </li>
      <li> Allow trailing whitespace on the HTTP request line - it violates the HTTP/1.1 spec, but it's harmless, and at least one client (TiVo's v1.3 http_get [not related to my own http_get]) generates it. </li>
      <li> Changed the capitalization on some HTTP headers we generate, to interoperate with a client (yes, the same one) that is too stoopid to do case-insensitive matching. </li>
      <li> Pass Accept-Language headers to CGIs. </li>
